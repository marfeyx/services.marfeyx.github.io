# Marfeyx - Creative Services Website

This is the official repository for the Marfeyx creative services portfolio website, live at services.marfeyx.ch

## Project Overview

This is a static website designed to showcase the web development and creative services offered by Marfeyx. The site is built with a focus on clean design, fast performance, and a clear presentation of services. It is fully responsive and includes features like a dark/light theme switcher and multi-language support.

## ✨ Features

*   **Responsive Design:** The layout adapts to all screen sizes, from mobile phones to desktop monitors.
*   **Theme Switcher:** Users can toggle between a light and dark mode for comfortable viewing.
*   **Multi-language Support:** The content can be switched between English and German.
*   **Static Site:** Built with pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for maximum performance and security.
*   **CSS Variables:** Used for easy theming and maintenance.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

*   **HTML5:** For the structure and content of the pages.
*   **CSS3:** For styling, layout, and animations. Custom properties (variables) are used extensively.
*   **JavaScript:** For interactive elements like the theme switcher and language toggle.

## 📝 Notes

### Design Philosophy

The design is intentionally minimal and content-focused. The goal is to provide information clearly and efficiently without unnecessary distractions. Animations are used sparingly to enhance the user experience without impacting performance.

### Customization

*   **Colors & Fonts:** The color scheme and typography can be easily modified by changing the CSS variables defined at the top of `index.css` and other page-specific CSS files.
